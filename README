Usage:

$ make
$ ./a.out

calcforce:  Calculate force between all particles.
calcforce_hand: ditto, but put i-particle explicitly on register
calcforce_if: calcforce with cutoff
calcforce_hand_if: calcforce_hand with cutoff
calcforce_hand_if_min: ditto, but conditional jump is removed by using std::min
calcforce_hand_if_condop: ditto, but conditional jump is removed by conditonal operator
